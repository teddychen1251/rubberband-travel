# Rubber Band Travel in VR

## Due date: 4/17

## Tasks

- Implement rubber-band travel
  - Start a “rubber band” when you bring controllers together and press a certain button
    - Use ribbons (similar to line tool) to draw it out
  - Translate the direction and “stretch” of the band to a force applied to your avatar
    - Resources for this math:
  - 3rd person view during travel
  - Mid-air extra boosts
    - Limit stretch of the rubber band?
- Create an obstacle course (use Blender?)
  - Platforms (in all directions)
  - Target landing practice
  - Training dummies to slice/shoot in midair
- Create an avatar to give the feeling of presence, like you’re in a FPS
  - Hands
  - “Inventory” - maybe a sword and a gun strapped to your back that you can grab/shot/slash during your travel?
    - (stretch) Maybe a med pack strapped to your wrist that you need two hands to apply
- Writeup
  - Include sources from 3DUI textbook
